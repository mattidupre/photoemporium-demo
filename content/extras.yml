  - name: Social Media Station
    price: $250
    description: Every booth is ready to send your pics to the beautysphere, but
      this separate kiosk keeps the line moving and smiles a-happening. View
      photos and share via email, text, or social straight from a tablet near
      the photo booth. Instead of two booths, just add a social media station.
  - name: Wedding Guest Book
    description: We have gifts for our wedding clients. Every wedding gets a
      Photobooth Guest Book and double prints for your friends to make a unique
      momento for you. We also create a fun video slideshow of all your images
      to get tons of likes on social. Besides the hokey pokey, that's what it is
      all about.
    price: $Free
  - name: Custom Backdrops
    price: $250
    description: Spread your logo love all over this backdrop. Send us your logo,
      designs, initials for a great step and repeat banner, or request something
      extra special. We'd love to help a brother out.
  - name: Inflatable Booth
    price: $150
    description: Sometimes we go against our grain and provide a little privacy in
      the booth. But it is a really big booth that can still fit about 15
      people. It also looks like it belongs on the moon - which is super cool.
  - description: Thought bubbles, logo, hashtags and more. Create your own props
      that will set your photobooth experience apart from everyone.
