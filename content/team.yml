  This whole photobooth thingamajig started when Matt wanted to add a little fun
  to a wedding he was shooting. It turns out that he created a unique beautiful
  experience for that bride. It was easy, fun and the bride thought it was
  absolutley ‘gorg!’  Now, the Photo Emporium applies that same ‘gorg’ to its
  same weddings and brand experiences. No other photo company in Alaska can
  provide the custom experience like the Photo Emporium.


  Enjoyable customer experiences, quality photography and memorable experiences is what drives this business. We hope you have fun shopping at the Photo Emporium!
