  **1. Ridiculous, Hilarious Fun!**


  A photo booth is instant fun. Not once in the hundreds of pictures we’ve taken has anyone been bored or sad.  As soon as guests see our photo booth a line forms and the fun begins.The laughter and hilarity that ensues inside the photo booth is contagious.  Guests let their guard down and next thing you know, Aunt Suzie has a unicorn head spelling lots of rainbow magic.  Not everyone will get out on the dance floor, but pretty much everyone will take a session inside our photo booth.  Our photo booth has been the hit of every event we’ve been to, from babies to grandparents, everyone has fun.
